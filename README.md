## Overview

Here, we use a regional random forest regression (RFR) to leverage data from multiple ocean observing instruments that offer different advantages. In our study of the Southern Ocean, we use RFR to produce new nutrient maps at 50 times higher resolution than previously possible. By estimating small-scale information, RFR reveals interactions between physical and biological processes during rapid mixing events that are normally difficult to observe. These short-lived interactions appear to be important in determining local nutrient content and therefore biological activity in this important ocean basin.

Given increasing observational coverage of the global oceans by Argo floats and other drifting profilers, RFR presents opportunities to derive additional value from these sometimes incomplete biogeochemical datasets. Such efforts to bridge observational gaps using new ocean technologies and machine learning techniques will expand our knowledge of global biogeochemical cycles at previously inaccessible scales.



## RFR Notebooks

<!-- Three main notebooks describe the (1) Random Forest model development, (2) application to ocean data and performance evaluation, followed by (3) scientific analysis of the output.

[Main Training Notebook](scripts/Training_RandomForest.ipynb) `scripts/Training_RandomForest.ipynb`

- Demonstrates our machine learning approach to ocean nutrient regression.
- Specifically, we go through these main steps: 

    1) Preparing BGC-Argo data for our model training data.
    2) Training the model on available BGC-Argo and shipboard data. 
    3) Validating different models to select optimal parameters; Cross-validating to minimize overfitting.
    4) Testing the RFR for error estimation; comparing with other algorithms
    5) Applying Seaglider inputs to predict new nitrate distributions. 


To run locally, install the environment `mlsogos` using the file `./binder/environment.yml`.
